Command line auto-compleation for lazybones

Sometimes it can be hard to rember the name of the lazybones template that you want to run. You can always run 
----
lazybones list
----
but, remeber... we are lazy. 

If you are like me, you probably use the same template over and over, but not quite enough to remeber the exact spelling. 

This is a start on lazybones auto-compleation for bash and zsh using the https://github.com/mbrubeck/compleat[compleat] DSL. 

----
lazybones create <tab> 
----

will show you the names of cached templates (ones you have run before). 

NOTE: I am too lazy to type out 'lazybones', so I created an 'lb' alias.

There is some setup required, but we will worry about that later. It takes a little bit of work to be this lazy.
